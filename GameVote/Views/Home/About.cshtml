<h2>@ViewBag.Title</h2>

<p>First someone will need to use the 'create new list' link in the menu to create a ballot of all games available that match the number of players and how much time we have to play.</p>

<p>Players then select their name and vote for the games they want to play. When 'check results' is clicked the vote is tallyed and all players that voted are listed along with the winning game. If not all players are listed then not all votes have been recived. The first person to see all players names(the last to vote) is the one that sees the true winning game.</p>

<p>I'm using a voting system similar to Single Transferable Vote. You get 3 votes, in order of primary -> tertiary. The program then takes the primary votes and checks to see if there is a game that was voted for by half+1 of the voters. If there is no winner it adds the secondary votes and checks again to see if any single game has half+1 of the votes. If that fails it adds the tertiary votes then selects the game with the most votes. Using half plus one ensures that a game only wins if the majority of players want it.</p>

<p>If there is a tie it randomly selects a winner from all games that tie by determining the largest number of votes, then removing all games from list that do not have that number of votes, then randomly selecting one of the remaining games</p>
