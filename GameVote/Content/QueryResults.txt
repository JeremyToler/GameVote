Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annettes hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire!</p></div><li class='well ballot'><h2 class='GameName_ballot'>Mysterium</h2> Vote1 <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='3378575a-6c2f-e611-80d6-008cfa5ae917' value='1'> &nbsp;|&nbsp; Vote2 <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='3378575a-6c2f-e611-80d6-008cfa5ae917' value='2'> &nbsp;|&nbsp; Vote3 <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='3378575a-6c2f-e611-80d6-008cfa5ae917' value='3'> &nbsp;|&nbsp; Unselect <input class='VotePos2' type='radio' name='3378575a-6c2f-e611-80d6-008cfa5ae917' value='0' checked='checked'><span class='ShowInfo' tabindex='0'>Show Me More</span><div class='HideInfo'><p class = 'GameStats'>Entertains 2 - 7 players for 42Min.</p><img src='https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2601683_md.jpg' Height = '150' class = 'GameImage'/><p class='GameDescription'>In the 1920s, Mr. MacDowell, a gifted astrologist, immediately detected a supernatural being upon entering his new house in Scotland. He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary séance, and they have seven hours to contact the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.

Unable to talk, the amnesic ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.</p></div><li class='well ballot'><h2 class='GameName_ballot'>Castle Panic</h2> Vote1 <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='156f09ce-6c2f-e611-80d6-008cfa5ae917' value='1'> &nbsp;|&nbsp; Vote2 <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='156f09ce-6c2f-e611-80d6-008cfa5ae917' value='2'> &nbsp;|&nbsp; Vote3 <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='156f09ce-6c2f-e611-80d6-008cfa5ae917' value='3'> &nbsp;|&nbsp; Unselect <input class='VotePos2' type='radio' name='156f09ce-6c2f-e611-80d6-008cfa5ae917' value='0' checked='checked'><span class='ShowInfo' tabindex='0'>Show Me More</span><div class='HideInfo'><p class = 'GameStats'>Entertains 1 - 6 players for 60Min.</p><img src='https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic496923_md.jpg' Height = '150' class = 'GameImage'/><p class='GameDescription'>The forest is filled with all sorts of monsters.
