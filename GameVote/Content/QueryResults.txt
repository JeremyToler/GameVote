Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire!</p><p class = 'GameStats'>Entertains 1 - 4 players for 1</p>   Primary: <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='9abc2cdc-1919-e611-80d3-008cfa5ae917' value='1'>  Secondary: <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='9abc2cdc-1919-e611-80d3-008cfa5ae917' value='2'>  Tertiary: <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='9abc2cdc-1919-e611-80d3-008cfa5ae917' value='3'>  Not Selected: <input type='radio' name='9abc2cdc-1919-e611-80d3-008cfa5ae917' value='0' checked='checked'><li id='56e9a313-9e1f-e611-80d4-008cfa5ae917' class='well NotSelected'><h2 class='GameName'>plantation road</h2><img src='../Content/Images/SW.jpg' Height = '150' class = 'GameImage'/><p class='GameDescription'>No Information Provided</p><p class = 'GameStats'>Entertains 2 - 3 players for 20</p>   Primary: <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='56e9a313-9e1f-e611-80d4-008cfa5ae917' value='1'>  Secondary: <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='56e9a313-9e1f-e611-80d4-008cfa5ae917' value='2'>  Tertiary: <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='56e9a313-9e1f-e611-80d4-008cfa5ae917' value='3'>  Not Selected: <input type='radio' name='56e9a313-9e1f-e611-80d4-008cfa5ae917' value='0' checked='checked'>
