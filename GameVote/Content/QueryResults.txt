Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire!</p><li class='well'><h2 class='GameName'>Dead of Winter</h2><p class = 'GameStats'>Entertains 2 - 5 players for 210Min.</p>   Primary: <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='c001b032-9226-e611-80d4-008cfa5ae917' value='1'>  Secondary: <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='c001b032-9226-e611-80d4-008cfa5ae917' value='2'>  Tertiary: <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='c001b032-9226-e611-80d4-008cfa5ae917' value='3'>  Not Selected: <input type='radio' name='c001b032-9226-e611-80d4-008cfa5ae917' value='0' checked='checked'><img src='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IV5KFs4y8cg/maxresdefault.jpg' Height = '150' class = 'GameImage'/><p class='GameDescription'>Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition — but for each individual player to achieve victory, he must also complete his personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! </p><li class='well'><h2 class='GameName'>One Night Ultimate Werewolf</h2><p class = 'GameStats'>Entertains 3 - 10 players for 10Min.</p>   Primary: <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='af6bf697-9226-e611-80d4-008cfa5ae917' value='1'>  Secondary: <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='af6bf697-9226-e611-80d4-008cfa5ae917' value='2'>  Tertiary: <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='af6bf697-9226-e611-80d4-008cfa5ae917' value='3'>  Not Selected: <input type='radio' name='af6bf697-9226-e611-80d4-008cfa5ae917' value='0' checked='checked'><img src='https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1809823.jpg' Height = '150' class = 'GameImage'/><p class='GameDescription'>No moderator, no elimination, ten-minute games.

One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a fast game for 3-10 players in which everyone gets a role: One of the dastardly Werewolves, the tricky Troublemaker, the helpful Seer, or one of a dozen different characters, each with a special ability.
