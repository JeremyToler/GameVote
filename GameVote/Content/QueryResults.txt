One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a fast game for 3-10 players in which everyone gets a role: One of the dastardly Werewolves, the tricky Troublemaker, the helpful Seer, or one of a dozen different characters, each with a special ability. In the course of a single morning, your village will decide who is a werewolf...because all it takes is lynching one werewolf to win!</p><li class='well'><h2 class='GameName'>Cards Against Humanity</h2><p class = 'GameStats'>Entertains 2 - 30 players for 20Min.</p>   Primary: <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='06c62ee3-3227-e611-80d4-008cfa5ae917' value='1'>  Secondary: <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='06c62ee3-3227-e611-80d4-008cfa5ae917' value='2'>  Tertiary: <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='06c62ee3-3227-e611-80d4-008cfa5ae917' value='3'>  Not Selected: <input type='radio' name='06c62ee3-3227-e611-80d4-008cfa5ae917' value='0' checked='checked'><img src='http://www.argn.com/images/cards-against-humanity-solution.jpg' Height = '150' class = 'GameImage'/><p class='GameDescription'>Cards Against Humanity is a party game for horrible people.
