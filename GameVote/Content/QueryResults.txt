Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire!</p><p class = 'GameStats'>Entertains 1 - 4 players for 1Min.</p><a href='/Home/Edit/9abc2cdc-1919-e611-80d3-008cfa5ae917' class='GameEdit'>Edit</a></li><li class='GameItem'><h2 class='GameName'>Backup Storage Wars</h2><img src='' Height = '150' class = 'GameImage'/><p class='GameDescription'></p><p class = 'GameStats'>Entertains 1 - 6 players for 0Min.</p><a href='/Home/Edit/35a557f0-1919-e611-80d3-008cfa5ae917' class='GameEdit'>Edit</a></li>
