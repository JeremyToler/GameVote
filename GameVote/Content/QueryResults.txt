Cutthroat Caverns is played over 9 rounds, each with a random encounter. Essentially a game of 'kill stealing'. Each round, any monster encountered will have a prestige value of 1 through 6. The player that successfully jockeys for position and lands the killing blow gets the prestige value for the encounter. Some encounters will not have a specific monster, such as a trap room for the heroes to pass through (and in this case, earning no prestige). The surviving player with the most prestige after the 9 encounters is the winner. If the players do not survive all 9 encounters, no one wins the game.

It's really simple!

Spyfall is played over several rounds, and at the start of each round all players receive cards showing the same location — a casino, a traveling circus, a pirate ship, or even a space station — except that one player receives a card that says "Spy" instead of the location. Players then start asking each other questions — "Why are you dressed so strangely?" or "When was the last time we got a payday?" or anything else you can come up with — trying to guess who among them is the spy. The spy doesn't know where he is, so he has to listen carefully. When it's his time to answer, he'd better create a good story!</p><li class='well'><h2 class='GameName'>Sushi Go!</h2><p class = 'GameStats'>Entertains 2 - 5 players for 15Min.</p> &nbsp;&nbsp; First Vote <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='7223c094-812e-e611-80d6-008cfa5ae917' value='1'> &nbsp;|&nbsp; Second Vote <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='7223c094-812e-e611-80d6-008cfa5ae917' value='2'> &nbsp;|&nbsp; Third Vote <input class='VotePos' type='radio' name='7223c094-812e-e611-80d6-008cfa5ae917' value='3'> &nbsp;|&nbsp; Unselect <input type='radio' name='7223c094-812e-e611-80d6-008cfa5ae917' value='0' checked='checked'><img src='https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1950458_md.jpg' Height = '150' class = 'GameImage'/><p class='GameDescription'>In the super-fast sushi card game Sushi Go!, you are eating at a sushi restaurant and trying to grab the best combination of sushi dishes as they whiz by.

Three to six players take on the roles of the great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, as they vie for control of the Iron Throne through the use of diplomacy and warfare. Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!</p>
